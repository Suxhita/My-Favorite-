        I love reading books, anybook at all, even if the only book I have in hand is my <p11>school book!!</p11> I find it fun, because all authors have different ways of telling the stories, and I love that! I love how whatever author narrates, it keeps us on the edge, waiting for us to know more, and slowly before you even realize it, you’re completely drawn to the book, forgetting all your problems, because right now, you just want to know what happens next. There are so many different genres to books, and there’s always a perfect one to get lost in. The plot twists, page-turners, the back story, the style, the beginning, middle, the end, the plot, it’s all for us to get hooked on! It’s not just stories; it’s a part of life! Just think of this; sitting on a comfortable chair, the sun is shining on you, but just the right amount for light, you’re outside, in a balcony, and a small breeze touches your face, and it makes the temperature just the right amount. You open the book, you read the first page, and you need to know more, and go on, finishing a few chapters, still sitting without a care in the world, and you feel like time is standing still, still for you finish that book. But time is moving, moving as each page you flip. And you can see what the author is trying to tell you, and you’re there, just as a bystander. You travel to the places where the main character goes seeing the supporting characters, trying to qualify them as villains or friends. In the end, when you close the book, the only thing you can think of, is how much you like the book.</center></p1><br />

    <p3>Percy Jackson series are the series that I love the most. Here are the book reviews I made earlier.</p3><br /><br />
    <p4>1) The Lightning Thief<br /><br />Percy returns home for summer vacation, after which he and his mortal mother Sally Jackson travel to their cabin in Montauk to take their mind off things and to escape Percy's stepdad, Gabe Ugliano. However, the trip is cut short after a series of harrowing incidents, such as being attacked by the Minotaur, resulting in the death of his mother. Percy finds himself at Camp Half-Blood, a training camp for demigods like him. He discovers that he is a demigod, son of Poseidon, the Greek god of the sea. Percy also learns that his best friend, Grover Underwood, is actually a satyr, a forest spirit with a human torso, horns, and a goat’s lower body and that Zeus is accusing Percy of having stolen his master bolt, the most powerful weapon in the universe. To clear his name, save the world from another war between the Olympian gods, and maybe even save his mother, Percy sets out to retrieve the lightning bolt from Hades, who is suspected of being the real thief. Thus, Percy, Grover, and Annabeth Chase, a daughter of Athena, start on a journey to the underworld, facing numerous mythological monsters on the way. After confronting an innocent Hades, they learn that their friend Luke Castellan, son of Hermes, is the real thief who stole the Lightning Bolt (also called the Master Bolt) to allow Kronos, the defeated King of the Titans from the past, a chance to rise again and that Ares, the Greek god of war, helped cover up Luke's crime in order to instigate a war between Olympians.<br /><br /><br />
        2) The Sea of Monsters<br /><br />
        Camp Half-Blood is under attack when Thalia's tree, which guards the borders of the camp, is poisoned and slowly begins to die. In order to save the tree and the camp, someone must recover the Golden Fleece, which is somewhere in the Sea of Monsters, the Bermuda Triangle. At the same time, Percy finds out that Grover, who has left on a quest to find the missing god Pan, has been captured by the Cyclops Polyphemus and that the Fleece is on Polyphemus' island. Together with Annabeth and his half-brother Tyson, a cyclops who just arrived at the camp, Percy sets out to rescue Grover, even though Tantalus, who had replaced Chiron, prohibited him from doing so. Meanwhile, Clarisse La Rue, daughter of Ares, is sent on an official quest by Camp Half-Blood to retrieve the Fleece. The trip to the Sea of Monsters is long and hazardous and along the way the heroes encounter several dangers including Scylla and Charybdis, the sorceress Circe, the Sirens and their former friend Luke Castellan. Percy also learns about a prophecy from the Oracle about a child of one of the three most important gods (Zeus, Poseidon and Hades), also called "the Big Three", playing a vital part in the success or failure of the resurrection of Kronos the Titan-King and saving Olympus. The heroes eventually retrieve the Fleece and restore Thalia's tree but also unknowingly revive Thalia herself, daughter of Zeus, who had been turned into the tree by her father when she sacrificed herself for Annabeth and Luke to get safely to Camp Half-Blood years earlier. <br /><br /><br />

        3) The Titan's Curse<br /><br />
        On a mission to rescue the half-bloods Bianca and Nico di Angelo; Percy, Annabeth, Thalia and Grover are attacked by a Manticore and rescued by the goddess Artemis and her Hunters. However, Annabeth falls off a cliff while fighting the manticore and is said to be captured. Later, Artemis is captured by Luke's army while on the hunt for the Ophiotaurus, a cow-serpent monster that was foretold to bring the downfall of Olympus when its entrails are sacrificed to a fire. Her lieutenant Zoë Nightshade, daughter of Atlas and a sister of the Hesperides leads Bianca, Thalia, and Grover on a quest to save her. Percy, who was not invited to join the party, follows them on behalf of Nico di Angelo, promising that he will do his best to protect his sister, Bianca. The others eventually find Percy, and he joins their group.
        <br />
        They become the prey of skeletons, who chase them across the country. Bianca is able to kill one, which leaves the others mystified. Bianca later dies as they make their way across a godly junkyard, and thus, Percy's promise to Nico is effectively broken. They find Annabeth with Luke and Artemis, who is holding up the sky. Percy then takes it from Artemis and they trick Atlas into his original position under the sky. Thalia replaces Zoë, who dies, as Artemis' lieutenant. Thalia's induction as a lieutenant of Artemis ensures that she will become immortal, never aging to 16, thus escaping the Great Prophecy and leaving Percy to fulfill it. They return to camp and Percy informs Nico about Bianca's death during the journey. Nico blames Percy for failing to protect her and runs away, only after causing skeletal warriors that invade the camp to fall into the dark void of the Underworld, thus alerting Percy to the fact that Hades is Nico and Bianca's father. <br /><br /><br />

        The Battle of the Labyrinth<br /><br />
        The Battle of the Labyrinth, the fourth installment in the series, was released on May 6, 2008. Percy, Annabeth, Grover and Tyson go on a quest to find Daedalus’ workshop and (maybe) Ariadne's string, which Luke Castellan and his army are looking for too. A swordsman named Quintus is subbing for Mr. D, who is on a mission to get the minor gods to be on the gods' side of the war. The questers go on a journey inside the labyrinth, facing many monsters. Once they find the workshop, they find out that Quintus is actually Daedalus in his 5th body. Daedalus dies and then they go back to camp and have a battle with Luke's army. Casualties include Castor and Lee Fletcher. After the battle, they prepare for the Battle of Manhattan, since Lord Kronos has risen to obliterate Olympus, in the body of Luke Castellan. <br /><br /><br />

        The Last Olympian<br /><br />
        Percy Jackson learns that Kronos' forces are preparing to attack Olympus. Poseidon, Percy's father, decides that it is time for Percy to now fulfill the Great Prophecy. Seeking a way to defeat Kronos, Nico di Angelo tells Percy his plan, though Percy doesn't like it. Percy bathes in the River Styx, making his body invulnerable except one small chosen part of his body (the small of his back). Kronos leads a siege of New York City and puts its citizens to sleep. Percy leads the campers, Hunters, nature spirits, and centaurs to protect Mount Olympus from Kronos and his forces. While they protect Olympus, the gods hold down the monster Typhon as he makes his way to New York. Kronos, possessing Luke's body, forces his way into Olympus and battles Percy in Olympus' throne room. Typhon reaches New York but is defeated after the arrival of Poseidon's forces, led by Tyson. <br />

        Annabeth is able to make Luke come back to his senses, and Percy gives him Annabeth's knife. Luke stabs himself in his mortal spot, his armpit (as he also was invulnerable from bathing in the River Styx) to destroy Kronos and save Mount Olympus, dying heroically. The gods reward Percy and his friends and offer him immortality. He rejects the offer but instead requests the gods to claim all their children and to have cabins for all the gods, including the minor ones. The Curse of the Oracle was bestowed by Hades when Zeus took his wife, and Rachel Elizabeth Dare becomes the next Oracle and recites the next Great Prophecy. The book finishes with Percy and Annabeth becoming an official couple, and ominous clouds looming over Rachel's next Great Prophecy. There are other series after this one called The Heroes of Olympus and The Trials of Apollo. <br />

    <p id="my_inspiration">My Inspiration</p>
    <p5><br />I live and breathe books, and I love it. There are many people whom inspire me. Such as:- <br /><br />
        1. My parents<br /><br />
        I love my parents, and they help me through anything, whatever it may be. They are one of my biggest inspirations. They are doctors, who help others each and every day. They might be very (very) strict at times, but I know that I need them to be so. <br /><br /><br />
        2. My teachers<br /><br />
        My teachers help me see the whole world just through a text book, they help me visualize and they have helped me speak, read, write, and most importantly, learn. They have explained to the gentlest times, and I for one, have taken them for granted many times. I hope that in the future, that I can help so many people find out what they want to be and help them change the world. <br /><br /><br />
        3. Authors<br /><br />
        I respect all authors around the world, no matter the language they write in. I read so many books, and I have come to love it so much. It inspires me how they explain every single detail, but in their vision, and they take you to them, like a movie everything plays out in your mind, every single smell, the feels, all done by the writers little fingers<br />
